    <h1>Welcome.</h1>
    <p>This site is intended for educational and harm reduction purposes, and does not encourage or endorse the use of
        psychedelic drugs.
        I hope to provide information that minimizes the negative outcomes for those using them, and
        educate others who are curious about the substances, their effects, and their uses.
        All of the information found on this website is secondary, meaning I have not done any research of my own but am
        instead relaying reliable information.
        I will do my best to provide the source of my information.</p>
